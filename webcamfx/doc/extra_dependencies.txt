# Extra dependencies not (fully) managed by Go

## GoCV

GoCV depends on OpenCV, which is implemented in C/C++. This means `cgo` and
some custom installation steps.

See the GoCV [Getting Started](https://gocv.io/getting-started/) Guide for
details.

### Extra packages for GoCV

I use KDE, probably that's the reason some Gnome packages were missing after
the GoCV [quick install](https://gocv.io/getting-started/linux/#quick-install).

```
$ go run ./cmd/faceblur/main.go 0 ./data/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
Gtk-Message: 15:09:44.833: Failed to load module "appmenu-gtk-module"

(main:35991): Gtk-WARNING **: 15:09:44.851: Unable to locate theme engine in module_path: "adwaita",
```

This fixed it for me:

```    
# apt install gnome-themes-standard appmenu-gtk2-module appmenu-gtk3-module
```
